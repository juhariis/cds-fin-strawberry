This is script for the team work for Copernicus Climate Data Services
couse in Finland 2020.

The script is not fully self explanatory and may produce unexpected results.
No guarantees given.

Calculations are not necessarily exactly right, the purpose within 
time constraints was to come up with a proof of concept
for potential further development only.

If you notice anything horrendoulsy wrong - or things that could be done 
in a better way, please let me know. 
My main language has been R and there are still a few strange areas in 
Python ecosystem (and climate data handling) where I very much would like 
to learn more.

Comments are very much appreciated
